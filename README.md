# Compliance-AI
Day 10 ‚Äì BA + AI Challenge
Excel + AI for Compliance & Healthcare Data

This repo is part of my 30-Day Business Analyst + AI Challenge.
On Day 10, I explored how combining Excel (pivot tables, summaries) with a lightweight ML model can reveal compliance insights faster.

 What I Did

Data Prep in Excel

Imported healthcare compliance dataset

Built PivotTables for quick summaries by department & category

AI Model (Python, Colab)

Trained a lightweight model on compliance risk flags

Extracted feature importance (what drives regulatory risk)

Predicted high-risk cases for proactive handling

Exports & Visuals

feature_importance_top20.csv ‚Üí Top factors driving risk

predictions_regulatory_flag.csv ‚Üí Predicted flags

top30_high_risk_cases.csv ‚Üí Prioritized risk cases

Visuals: Feature importance histogram + line plot

 Key Insights

AI can reduce hours of manual review into minutes of analysis

Feature importance helped pinpoint billing & documentation as top compliance pain points

Predictive flags allowed early detection of high-risk cases

‚ö° Takeaway

AI won‚Äôt replace Business Analysts.
But it will help us move from manual reporting ‚Üí proactive insights üöÄ.
